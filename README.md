# Clawdmatey 🏴‍☠️🤖

**clawd-matey.eth**

**Clawdmatey** is an AI-powered DeFi treasury bot that claims Clanker creator fees for $YARR on Base and automatically reinvests them into a diversified on-chain portfolio — fully automated.

## 💰 Tokenomics & Buyback

### Buyback Mechanism
- **20% of all claimed fees** are used to buy YARR on the open market
- Creates constant buy pressure from trading activity
- Purchased YARR held in treasury

### Burn Mechanism  
- If treasury holds **>5% of YARR supply** → excess is burned
- Deflationary pressure when treasury grows
- Prevents treasury from becoming a whale

### Fee Source
- **57% creator share** of all YARR trading fees (Clanker v3)
- Fees accumulate in WETH + YARR
- Claimed hourly when >$10 threshold

### Net Effect
```
Trading Activity → Fees → Auto-Claim → 20% Buyback → Hold/Burn
                                     → 80% Diversify → Treasury Growth
```

## What It Does

Every hour:
1. Checks unclaimed Clanker creator fees for $YARR on Base
2. If fees ≥ $10: claims them, splits across the portfolio
3. Always: swaps 5% of treasury WETH into the portfolio
4. If holding >5% of YARR supply: burns only the excess above the 5% floor

## How It Works

```
Every hour (cron):
  1. Check Clanker fees for YARR on Base
     ├─ No fees / below $10 threshold
     │    └─ Sweep YARR → treasury
     │    └─ Swap 5% of treasury WETH into portfolio
     └─ Fees ≥ $10
          └─ Claim all fees (swap non-WETH to WETH)
          └─ Split WETH 20/20/20/20/20
          └─ Buy each token via Uniswap v3 / Clanker pools
               GRT: bridge WETH Base→Arbitrum via Across, then swap
               RED/YARR: Clanker pool router (custom AMM)
               WBTC/CLAWD: Uniswap v3 on Base
          └─ If >5% YARR supply held: burn excess above 5% floor
          └─ Swap 5% of treasury WETH into portfolio
```
